# ePortfolio

This is an ePortfolio I have built for myself with React.js which displays my interests and accomplishments in an interactive, iPadOS-style interface

_THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS_

## Future Plans

1. Display information inside of apps
2. Redirect [edwardboguslavsky.ca](www.edwardboguslavsky.ca) to ePortfolio (currently linked to old personal website)
3. Add interactive widgets to front page
